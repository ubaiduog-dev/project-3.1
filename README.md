 IPL Match Analysis

An analytical project that studies IPL match data to understand the key factors that influence match outcomes and help franchises make better decisions.

 Business Question

What actually decides an IPL match, and what does that mean for how a franchise should prepare?

This project analyzes match results, toss decisions, team performance, player performance, venues, and ball-by-ball data to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on winning an IPL match.

 Dataset

The dataset contains five tables covering 19 IPL seasons from 2008 to 2026:

* `matches.csv` — match details, toss information, results, and player of the match.
* `deliveries.csv` — ball-by-ball batting, bowling, runs, extras, and wickets.
* `players.csv` — player information and playing styles.
* `teams.csv` — IPL team information.
* `venues.csv` — venue and city information.

## Data Profiling

Data profiling is the process of understanding the dataset before making any changes to it.

### What was done

- Inspected the five IPL tables:
  - `matches`
  - `deliveries`
  - `players`
  - `teams`
  - `venues`
- Checked the number of rows and columns.
- Checked distinct values in important columns.
- Identified missing values and blank values.
- Checked duplicate records.
- Investigated inconsistent names and categories.
- Recorded the identified data quality issues in a Data Quality Log.

### Output

- Data Dictionary
- Data Quality Log
- List of issues that need to be fixed in the next stage

> **Important:** No data was changed during profiling. It was only inspected and documented.

## Data Preparation

Data preparation fixes the problems identified during data profiling and creates a clean dataset for analysis.

### What was done

- Converted blank values into proper `NULL` values.
- Standardized inconsistent categories and names.
- Cleaned venue names.
- Removed duplicate venue records.
- Filled missing city values where possible.
- Converted season information into a usable year.
- Defined which matches should be treated as wins.
- Combined the cleaning rules to create `matches_clean`.

The cleaning rules were written in separate SQL files and executed in order.

### Output

A cleaned table called:

`matches_clean`

The raw tables were not modified.

## Data Analysis

Data analysis uses the cleaned data to answer cricket-related business questions and find useful patterns.

### Analysis Views

Three main views were created:

- `v_ball` – one row per ball
- `v_innings` – one row per team innings
- `v_match_totals` – one row per completed match

These views make it easier to analyze different levels of IPL data.

### Areas Analyzed

- Batting
- Batting roles
- Innings phases
- Bowling
- Pace vs Spin
- Bowling specialists
- Toss
- Batting first vs Chasing
- Venues
- Teams
- Wickets and dismissals
- Seasons
- Player scouting

### Analysis Process

Each analysis follows a simple process:

**Question → SQL Query → Result → Interpretation → Finding**

Minimum sample requirements are used where necessary to avoid misleading results from very small samples.

### Output

- SQL analysis queries
- Numerical results
- Charts
- Analysis findings and conclusions

The analysis is performed using the cleaned data rather than the original raw tables.
